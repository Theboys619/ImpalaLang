### Operators

Impala has a few math operators and some logical operators.

The math operators are `["*", "/", "%", "+", "-"]`.
And some logical ones are `["||", "&&", ">", "<", ">=", "<=", "==", "!="]`.

Some others ones are the `+=` and `=` signs which assign or increment values to a variable.

**Example**

```cpp
number anumbervar = 5;

anumbervar += 1;
anumbervar++;

log(anumbervar) // $ This should print 7
```
