### Variables

Variables can have many datatypes.
These include numbers, strings, booleans, or a type of anything.

The variables can also be constant which means they can never change.

Assigning the wrong datatype or assigning to a constant will throw an error.
This is great because you can debug code faster and easier.

```cpp
number x = 45;
string msg = "Hello there";
bool boolean = true;
any variable = "Anything can be here"; // Automatically assigns the type to the variable

const any variable = "A constant variable with a type of anything"; // Auto assign type

log(msg); // Built-In function
```
